# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Install the python-telegram-bot library
pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade

# If you are using additional libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, numpy, etc.), install them as well
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scipy
pip install python-binance


Step 4: Set Up Your Bot with BotFather
Open Telegram and search for the bot named BotFather.
Start a chat with BotFather and use the command /newbot to create a new bot.
Follow the prompts to set up your bot and receive a token. Make sure to store this token securely, as it will be used to authenticate your bot.
Step 5: Create Your Configuration File
Create a file named config.py (or config.py, as per your previous setup) in your project directory to store your bot token and other configurations:
python
# config.py

# Telegram bot credentials
bot_token = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'
chat_id = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID'  # Replace with your chat ID or group chat ID

# List of selected symbols to monitor (if applicable)
SELECTED_SYMBOLS = ['BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'BNBUSDT']  # Add your desired trading pairs here

Step 6: Create Your Bot Script
Create a file named bot.py (or main.py, depending on your structure) and add the following code to set up a simple bot:
python
# bot.py
import os
from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import ApplicationBuilder, CommandHandler, ContextTypes
import config  # Adjust to your config file

async def start(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE) -> None:
    await update.message.reply_text(f'Hello {update.effective_user.first_name}!')

async def main():
    app = ApplicationBuilder().token(config.bot_token).build()
    
    app.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
    
    await app.run_polling()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())

Step 7: Run Your Bot
With everything set up, you can run your bot script:
bash
python bot.py

Step 8: Test Your Bot
Open Telegram and search for your bot using its username.
Start a chat with the bot and send the command /start. The bot should respond with a greeting.
Additional Notes
Keep Your Token Secure: Never share your bot token publicly or hard-code it into scripts that are shared.
